    "Those are terms used to describe a conditional relationship between two statements. Usually, we define those statemets as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P$$\n",
    "$$Q$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $P$ is the first statement, and $Q$ is the second one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In a sufficiency relationship** we consider the following logic statement to be `true`:\n",
    "$$P \\longrightarrow Q$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, `if P` `then Q`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{If Plato doesn't know, them no one knows}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example creates a sufficiency relationship, where `Plato doesn't know` is $P$ and `no one knows` is $Q$. Considering this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P \\longrightarrow Q$$\n",
    "$$\\text{Plato doesn't know} \\longrightarrow \\text{no one knows}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, **in a necessity relationship**, we have the reciprocal logic. Basically, saying that $P$ is a necessary condition for $Q$ is the same as saying:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q \\longrightarrow P$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can say the following statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text {If someone gets home, my dog will bark}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this example we have:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "P = \\text{someone gets home} \\\\\n",
    "Q = \\text{my dog barks}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Saying that is the same as saying `My dog barks is a necessity condition for someone to get home`, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
